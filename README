ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

1. java.util.Random  
    public Random();
    public int nextInt(int bound);
    Referring to BigJava, Section 6.9.1, Random numbers and Simulations

2. public abstract void setPaint( Paint paint );
3. public abstract void fill(Shape s);
4. public abstract void setColor(Color c);
5. public abstract void drawString(String str, int x, int y);

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

1. If we resize the frame generated from CoinSimViewer, the size of strings revealing the label of each bar won't be resied accordingly.
2. There is reserved area at the bottom of a frame where we can't draw any strings.
3. You may not continue doing more times once the simulation finishes.
