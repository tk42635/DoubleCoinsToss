CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

1. java.util.Random  
    public Random();
    public int nextInt(int bound);
    Referring to BigJava, Section 6.9.1, Random numbers and Simulations

2. public abstract void setPaint( Paint paint );
3. public abstract void fill(Shape s);
4. public abstract void setColor(Color c);
5. public abstract void drawString(String str, int x, int y);

----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

1. If we resize the frame generated from CoinSimViewer, the size of strings revealing the label of each bar won't be resied accordingly.
2. There is reserved area at the bottom of a frame where we can't draw any strings.
3. You may not continue doing more times once the simulation finishes.

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:



----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1.  Code offered by Java Documentation

2.  Two-head: 25%
    Two-tail: 25%
    One-head one-tail: 50%

    According to the probability theory, there are 4 cases in total 2 of which contribute to the consequence of One-head one-tail
    and therefore the chance of this result is 2 times as large as any of others.

3. 800 or so.

4. Max valid trials:  2147483647
   Errors occurring from 2147483648
